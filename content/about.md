After spending many years as a technology transformation consultant, strategic advisor and CIO, I have now turned my focus to using futures thinking and strategic foresight to help organisations overcome their biggest problems.

I believe that futures thinking offers the best way for organisations to develop more robust strategies that adapt to today's rapidly changing business environment.

I've worked with a diverse range of clients, particularly in the not-for-profit sector in aged care and disability services, and I am passionate about working with organisations that make positive changes in our world.
